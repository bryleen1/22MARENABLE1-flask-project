## DevOps Core Fundamental Project
### **Author** – Bryleen Karimakwenda

## **Objective**
To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.  
Deliverables to meet this objective includes:
* Managing project progress through the use of a Kanban Board
* Using a Cloud Hosted managed Database and Compute Engine.
*	Creating a Python based application with CRUD functionality
*	Unit Testing with Python (Pytest)
*	Producing a functional front-end using Flask (HTML)
*	Using Git version control
*	Automating processes using Jenkins

## **Project proposal**
I propose to make a flask web application that is simply a digital to-do list. This application will be hosted on a GCP virtual instance and will also use GCP’s database instance. The app will allow the user to input tasks, view tasks, update task inputs and delete tasks. This will fulfil the CRUD functionality requirement of the project.  
The CRUD functionality of this app is as follows:
* Create – Inputting tasks
* Read – Viewing tasks added
* Update – Editing the content of tasks in the database 
* Delete – Removing individual tasks from the database 

## **Project design**
After coming up with the project idea, I brainstormed my ideas for the app and then used the MoSCoW  prioritisation technique to decide what a minimum viable product would look like.  
**Must have**  
A column with tasks and a column that shows the date the column was added
An external database hosted on the cloud
Ability to update a task from the website and the database
Ability to delete a task from the website and the database
An external database hosted on the cloud  
**Should have**  
A progress column whereby the user could say whether they’ve completed or started the task  
**Could have**  
Option for users to send tasks to their emails so that they don’t have to be on the app to see their tasks
